# Coding Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This Code Exercise has the follow requirements:

* The user needs to be able to search web news, by completing an input text box and clicking on a “Search” button. 
* Results should be read with an asynchronous request and shown below the search bar. The page should not reload completely at any point.
* Results should be displayed in a specific card format. Each item should include a thumbnail (if provided), a title and the first 20 words of the item body, followed by an ellipsis (“…”) punctuation mark.
* Clicking on a news thumbnail should visualize the full-sized image in a popup. The popup should be part of the screen and not a separate new window/tab.
* Each news item should include a “Read more” link below the description text. This link should open the original item URL in a separate window.
* A pagination bar should be included below the results to enable the user to navigate through the result set.

## Libraries

* Typescript
* Bootstrap 4
* Axios
* Formik
