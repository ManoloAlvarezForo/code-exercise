        "body": "February 3, 2021\n3 min read\nA Missouri state representative has been charged with 20 counts of fraud, including Covit-19, which falsely claimed to have stem cells.\nPatricia Ashton Derges, 63, called clients at the Oscar Valley Medical Clinic seeking treatment for a variety of ailments known as regenerative treatments. According to a major arbitrator indictment not released Monday\nThe clinic provided amniotic fluid to its patients claiming to have stem cells, but was actually cellular without stem cells.\nAn investigation was launched in April on the Springfield television station after Derges claimed he could treat false claims to Govt-19. The FBI said in a statementOn Monday.\nOn Facebook, Derges accused his clinic of providing a potentially safe and natural cure for COVID-19 patients.\nThe U.S. Attorneys Office said Monday that he had surrendered on his charges and was released following an initial appearance in federal court.\nTerzas said the actions were a betrayal of the trust placed in him by both a health expert and government official, Timothy Langan, a special agent for the FBIs Kansas City office.\nDerges vowed not to do any harm as a health professional and was chosen to serve the people and not disappoint them, Lankan said.  He used his position for personal gain and damaged public confidence.\nAccording to the indictment, Derges treated patients with the promise that stem cells would help alleviate a variety of health problems ranging from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to erectile dysfunction.  Derges, an assistant physician who graduated from the Caribbean Medical University in Karachi in May 2014, is said to have given the treatments himself.\nThe clinic obtained amniotic fluid through the University of Utah at approximately 4 244.00 per ml.  Derges charged his patients between $ 50,950 and $ 4,450 per milliliter of amniotic fluid, the indictment said, adding that some paid up to $ 6,500 for what they thought were treatments by stem cells.\nThe indictment alleges that patients paid approximately 1 191,815 for amniotic fluid that did not contain stem cells.\nFederal attorneys for the western district of Missouri said Derges had several emails to the medical director of cell therapy and regeneration at the University of Utah in 2019, who said there were no stem cells in the fluid.\nDerges was attacked by eight counts of wire fraud in connection with allegedly charging unidentified patients for fake stem cell treatment.  A maximum of 000 250,000 in each count is punishable by a fine and up to 20 years in prison.\nHe faces two counts of providing materially false, imaginary and fraudulent reports about his amniotic fluid treatments to federal investigators last year, each facing up to five years in prison.\nProsecutors also allege that Terges prescribed oxycodone and adrenaline to people online without a proper medical assessment.  She faces 10 counts of distribution through the internet without a valid drug, each serving a maximum of 20 years in prison.\nThis defendant abused the privilege of enriching himself by deceiving himself, U.S. Attorney Tim Garrison said in an FBI statement.  The accusation alleges that he lied to his patients and that he lied to federal agents. As an elected officer and health care provider, he deserves a higher standard.\nDerges, a Republican, ran unopposed for the districts 140 state home constituency in November and was elected for a two-year term.  He did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his government email address.\nIn a Facebook post on Monday night, Derges quoted the biblical story of David and Goliath, saying that God would be by his side.\nLies and twisted words mean nothing.  Truth and justice refer to everything, the post said.  I can stand before God and know that He will laugh at me. No matter how hard Goliath tries, he cant take it.\nDerges lawyer, Stacey Calhoun, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.  She said Kansas City StarHe admitted that he was limited in what he could say in the matter and that his client was not guilty of all charges.\nDr.  Derges, despite his appearance yesterday, has not been found guilty or guilty of anything, said Beaulieu.\nDoha Madani",

When data from all volunteers, including those who have experienced very mild cases of Covid-19 and those who do not need medical help, are considered, Button said Tuesday that the overall performance rate is dropping to 50.38%.\nDespite the very low efficacy rates of any new corona virus vaccine, coronavac is still more effective than some flu vaccines and can be stored cheaply in a normal refrigerator, making it a viable option for developing countries, public health experts said.\nHowever, this is a fragmentary and unusual announcement of Coronavacs performance rate The first month is scheduled to be announced last month Risks of damaging the reliability of many vaccines Brazilians are already reluctant to take Doctors said.",
